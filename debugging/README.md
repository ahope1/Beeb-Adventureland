# Debugging the BASIC version of Adventureland

**adv01.sck** is a decompilation, using [ScottKit](https://github.com/MikeTaylor/scottkit), of the widely available later version of the game datafile for Adventureland. The game datafile is distributed in a format known as ".DAT format" or "TRS-80 format". The game datafile has been "decompiled" with ScottKit.

**beeb adv01.dat** is the result of manually reformatting the DATA values in the TRS-80 BASIC lsiting of Adventureland as published in SoftSide magazine in 1980. The DATA values have been reformatted into the aforementioned .DAT/TRS-80 format. See the update history of this file to see the applied bugfix.
