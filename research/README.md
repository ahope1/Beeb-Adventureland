# Research materials and background info for Beeb-Adventureland

**adventureland.cas** is a TRS-80 tape-image that was sent to me by Jimmy Maher of the Digital Antiquarian blog. He's not sure what's on it, and nor am I as I can't get it to load successfully in any emulator!

**games.dsk** is a TRS-80 disk-image, also sent to me by Jimmy Maher. It seems to contain the standard Scott Adams BASIC adventure interpreter from way back. It's the same as or similar to the one that I got from the Data Driven Gamer website in order to extract the data for Adventureland in the first place.
