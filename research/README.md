# Research materials and background info for Beeb-Adventureland

**adventureland.cas** is a TRS-80 tape-image that was sent to me by Jimmy Maher of the Digital Antiquarian blog. He's not sure what's on it, and neither am I because I can't get it to load successfully with any program (or even with CLOAD) in any emulator!

**adventureland.cas.txt** is the output of ACAS.exe, the [CAS File Checker (or ACAS CAS Analyzer)](http://www.trs-80.com/wordpress/conversion-tape-utilities/), after it had finished processing the tape-image adventureland.cas (above). The content of _adventureland.cas.txt_ is utterly incomprehensible to me!

**games.dsk** is a TRS-80 disk-image, also sent to me by Jimmy Maher. It seems to contain the standard Scott Adams BASIC adventure interpreter from way back. The interpreter is the same as, or similar to, the one that I got from the [Data Driven Gamer website](http://datadrivengamer.blogspot.com/2018/11/adventureland-introduction-to-trs-80.html) (which I modified to make it print out the data for Adventureland from the Data Driven Gamer's .WAV tape-image â€” which is how this repo got started). The disk-image _games.dsk_ also contains the [buggy version](https://github.com/ahope1/Beeb-Adventureland/issues/5#issue-689671276) of the Adventureland datafile-builder program.
